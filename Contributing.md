### How can you help?

**Join our efforts on GitHub!**

We are looking for help to improve the user interface,
improve the user experience,
improve the responsivity by accelerating image rendering,
allow operation in different devices (different Web browsers, iOS, Android),
testing with different nifti files,
add the ability to open files from a URL,
improving the documentation, creating tutorials. We are also open
to hearing your ideas for improvement
